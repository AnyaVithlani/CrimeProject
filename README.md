# CrimeProject

Profiling violent and anti-social crimes following Brexit and plotting this by diversity. Then monitoring if Brexit created spikes in areas which are labelled as diverse and if this level was maintained.
Will show if the home office needs to allocate more resources to areas which are classed as diverse or if it is unecessary , and for future with other political changes e.g. when Brexit is a reality if resources need to be again reallocated and for how long. 
This is the code repository for the project, code was not uploaded as the project progressed as it was not a collaborative project.
